# Using the Webserver

TeamTrack allows communication and control using a built-in webserver. The webserver is reachable as http://192.168.4.1 after joining a given node, where all nodes behave as an access point.

To access any TeamTrack node Control Panel, you must go to your cellphone's Settings, Network & internet, then Wi-Fi. In a normal setting your Wi-Fi may already use an existing access point. You will need to stop using this existing access point. Before changing the access point, touch the gear icon for the current access point. The gear icon is on the very right. Select Advanced, and then disable Auto-connect.

Go back to Settings, Network and internet, WiFi, and select an SSID that matches the name of your node and select it. Android may complain that there is no internet and it will ask if you want to stay connected. Select yes.

Once your cellphone is using a TeamTrack node as an access point, exit Settings and bring up the cellphone's browser. Go to http://192.168.4.1 and you should see the Control Panel. From there you have the ability to touch the buttons and perform actions. It is highly recommended that you pin the address to the browsers's home screen in order to make it easier to select in the future.
